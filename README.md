# 🚀 Employee Directory – Frontend Project

A responsive and interactive Employee Directory built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, simulating dynamic data handling without any backend. Users can **Add, Edit, Delete, Search, Sort, Filter**, and **Paginate** employee records with a modern, user-friendly interface.

## 📦 1. Setup & Run Instructions

### ✅ No Backend Required

This is a 100% frontend project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### ▶️ To Run:
1. **Clone or Download** this project.
2. Open the folder in **VS Code** or any browser-supported editor.
3. Run the project:
   - ✅ Right-click `index.html` → **“Open with Live Server”**
   - OR double-click `index.html` to open in your browser.

> ⚠️ Do NOT open `.ftlh` files — this project simulates Freemarker with plain `.html`.

## 💡 4. Reflection

### 🔧 Challenges Faced
- Handling **edit vs add** logic with shared form
- Implementing **pagination that works with filtered search results**
- Avoiding Freemarker while maintaining dynamic rendering
- Managing all employee data through **`localStorage`** for persistence

### 🔁 Improvements (If More Time Was Available)
- Add **multi-field filters** and department-based grouping
- Integrate **animations or transitions** to enhance UX
- Add **profile images** per employee
- Export employee list to **CSV/Excel**
- Use templating (Handlebars, React) for cleaner rendering logic

## ✅ Final Notes

This project shows how to build a fully functional, responsive web app using only frontend technologies. While Freemarker was part of the initial brief, this version cleanly simulates its functionality using **JavaScript and localStorage** — ensuring the app runs independently without backend requirements.
